# CPL Scala
The CPL Languages (LET, PROC,...) implemented in Scala.

## Running on your machine
Import in Intellij (or your IDE of choice) and it should just work I think?

If you want to run the worksheets (*.sc), be sure to first manually build the project.

## Contributing
This project is made so I personally understand the materials better, because I implemented them.
Hence it is highly unlikely that a PR with a language that has not been implemented yet will be accepted, but don't be afraid to fork it!

Comments, annotations, pointing out my dumb mistakes,... are more than welcome!
